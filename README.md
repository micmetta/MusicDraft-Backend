## Run MusicDraft-Backend
In the terminal, you will need to type `minikube start` to start Kubernetes. Once you've done that, you should type `kubectl apply -f Kube` to deploy all the necessary files. At this point, you will need to wait for all the pods to enter the running state (Note: this may take a few minutes). After this is done, you should start the MusicDraft Front-End (https://github.com/micmetta/MusicDraft-Frontend).
